### To Do


Prevent placement over players (determine overlap with player collider and tile we want to place at),
Add collider and physics body to client projections (other players)

Add World bounds to scene, world bounds acts as a border for both physics and camera. Colliders cannot pass the bounds, cameras will not show further than bounds

Fix sending variable length strings as packets over network,
